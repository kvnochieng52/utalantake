                    entered into content provision agreements. UTALANTA is therefore not responsible for ensuring that
                    the content conforms to any quality standards or that it does not infringe upon the Intellectual
                    Property Rights or commercial interests of any person.</p>

                    unlimited basis as long as your content remains uploaded on the platform.</p>
